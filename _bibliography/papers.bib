  abstract={Seeking to adapt to a rapidly changing market,
the automotive industry is interested in flexible assembly lines
that can handle disruptions resulting from machine failures,
scheduling changes, or stochastic task times. In this paper, we
propose a layout for transporting cars that incorporates mobile
robotic platforms capable of moving off of the assembly line
when disruptions occur. We use discrete event simulation to
analyze the throughput of our flexible layout on a segment
of an automotive assembly line, with the results indicating
average speed improvements of 26% and 36% compared with a
conventional layout for a single band and two bands with a finite
buffer, respectively. In addition, we study the robustness of the
flexible layout in the presence of additional inefficiencies inherent
in the adoption of new technologies. Next, we present analytical
models for throughput analyses of both layouts. We improve upon
previous two-machine line analytical models by augmenting the
state space to model every machine in a band, and report that the
discrete models best approximate the throughput in most cases.},

  title={Analytical and simulation models for flexible, robotic automotive assembly lines},
  author={Tung, Yi-Shiuan},
  abstract={To adapt to the rapidly changing market, the automotive industry is interested in flexible assembly lines that can handle disruptions due to machine failures or schedule changes. In this thesis, we propose a new assembly line layout (flexible layout) that uses mobile, robotic platforms to transport cars, which can move out of the line when disruptions occur to prevent blocking other cars on the line. We use discrete event simulation and analytical models to analyze the throughput of the new layout in a single band and two bands with a finite buffer. The simulation results show that the new layout achieves an average of 25.6% and 35.9% speed up over the conventional layout for the single band and two bands cases respectively. We improve previous two-machine line analytical models by augmenting the state of the Markov chain to model every machine in a band. We show that the augmented discrete Markov chain model predicts the throughput within 13% and 18% of the simulation throughput for the conventional and flexible layouts respectively. We further evaluate whether the flexible layout can improve its throughput by learning a policy for parking the platforms. By modeling the agents as independent learners, we apply single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms and show that the policy learned works well but suffers from lack of coordination.},
